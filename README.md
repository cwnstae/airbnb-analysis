# Introduction
Welcome to this Airbnb analysis, designed to showcase the comprehensive skills required for data analytics. In this project, I will utilize various tools to manipulate the "Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset" provided by Alex The Analyst ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset)).

## What you will see
In this showcase, I will cover various methods to tackle this large dataset, including data cleaning, data formatting, and creating a database for SQL demonstrations. You will see how I manipulate the data using Python, and finally, I will summarize and describe the insights derived from the data. I will also create a visualization dashboard using Tableau.

## Key skills showcased
 - Python (pandas): The primary tool I use to manipulate and format the data.
 - SQL: Used to create a database and demonstrate querying for data exploration.
 - Tableau: Utilized to interpret and present the insightful data in an understandable manner through graphs and dashboards.

# Loading and exporing data
In this section we will load the data and explore to see the detail before analysis and find the way to deal with dirty-data and formating it into usable data. the dataset we use is <table><td>Tableau Full Project.xlsx</td></table>
